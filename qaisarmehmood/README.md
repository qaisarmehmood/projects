## New York demographics

Chloropleth Map of New York showing the Population under age  5 in all New York counties for years 2010-2015 using data from census.gov.
According to the data from the census.gov the county with highest population is Jefferson County and the lowest population County is Hamilton County. 
The goal is to differentiate the counties with a highest percentage of population with the ones with lowest using a color scheme.

## To Do

1. Add a map showing all the US states and Counties.
2. Filter only the New York counties from the map.

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

1. 1 or 2 sentences describing overall project goals, e.g., interactive tool?, hypothesis test? (0% complete)
2. Attribution and links to all data sources (0% complete)
    * describe parameters used in census.gov API query
3. Extremely brief description of all pre-processing (0% complete)
    * Got census data (by hand) and put it in CSV file in the repo

#### Technical

For each steps, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Create plot of NY Counties based on us-atlas (if starting from one of Mike Bostock's blocks, provide a link)
2. Integrate data from census.gov to create chloropleth map using FIPS
